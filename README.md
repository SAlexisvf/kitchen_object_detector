# Kitchen detector using Tensorflow object detection API and Google Colab

Trained a model to detect 3 objects in my kitchen

I wrote a step by step documentation on how I trained the model using Google Colab and is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/RoBorregos/Robocup-Home/wiki/Object-Detection) of the open source repository of RoBorregos @Home.
